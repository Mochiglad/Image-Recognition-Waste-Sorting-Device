**The Image Recognition Waste Sorting Device is a simple and effective solution to improper waste management.**

Implemented functionalities:

-   Waste categorization using image recognition
    
-   Waste bin has two operation modes, automatic and manual:
    

-   Automatic:
    

-   Opens the correct bin (i.e. garbage, recycling, or compost) based on the type of waste thrown away
    
-   Remembers the previous state of each bin when it was in manual mode
    

-   Manual:
    

-   User can manually toggle each bin open and closed
    
-   Manual control done through both the website and app
    
-   Shows a log of when each bin was accessed
    
-   User can access different bins using their respective ids
    

-   Log kept of when each bin was accessed
    
-   Supports multiple waste bins using a unique id assigned to each bin
    
-   Count of the number of items that have been deposited into the bins and reset button
    

  

Main components:

-   Physical waste bin, 3x Plastic bags
    
-   Raspberry Pi (Pi Camera, Ultrasonic sensor, 3 x Servo motors, 7-segment display)
